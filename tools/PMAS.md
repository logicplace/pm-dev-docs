## Usage

## Mnemonics and registers

PMAS used mnemonics based on Intel x86 architectures since the official ones weren't known at the time.
For those who are adapting from it, reading old code, or are for some reason using this tool still, here is a list for converting the operations.

In the following lists, we use these symbols:

| Symbol             | Meaning                                       |
|:------------------:| --------------------------------------------- |
| `r`                | 8-bit register: e.g. A, B, L, or H            |
| `rp`               | 16-bit register: e.g. BA, HL, IX, IY, or SP   |
| `er`               | Indexing register: NB, EP, XP, or YP          |
| `nn` or `pp`       | Unsigned 8-bit immediate data                 |
| `dd` or `rr`       | Signed 8-bit immediate (offset, usually)      |
| `mmnn` or `hhll`   | Unsigned 16-bit immediate                     |
| `qqrr`             | Signed 16-bit immediate (offset)              |
| `x` or `y`         | Any valid register or immediate               |
| `t`                | Any valid 8-bit target (register or indirect) |
| `tt`               | Any valid 16-bit target                       |
| `s`                | Any valid 8-bit source (target or immediate)  |
| `ss`               | Any valid 16-bit source                       |
| `$`                | Flag name (incl. N$) in a conditional branch  |

Valid means "forms a defined operation".
S1C88 code requires immediate data be prefixed with `#` while PMAS does not. So keep this in mind when looking at variables like `x` in the operations lists below.

### Registers

Registers marked as `n/a` in the PMAS column did not have any equivalent.
Note that S1C88 does not allow access to the CB register and any operation which used in in PMAS will use NB in S1C88 tools.
Additionally, the CC register cannot be directly accessed by software and can only be used as a branch condition.

| PMAS register | S1C88 register | Description                                |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| A             | A              | data register A, the Accumulator           |
| B             | B              | data register B                            |
| BA            | BA             | BA pair register                           |
| H             | H              | data register H                            |
| L             | L              | data register L                            |
| HL            | HL             | index register HL                          |
| X or X1       | IX             | Index register IX                          |
| Y or X2       | IY             | Index register IY                          |
| SP            | SP             | Stack Pointer                              |
| N             | BR             | Base Register                              |
| F             | SC             | System Condition flags                     |
| n/a           | CC             | Custom Condition flags                     |
| PC            | PC             | Program Counter                            |
| U             | NB             | New code Bank register                     |
| V             | CB             | current Code Bank register                 |
| I             | EP             | Expand Page register                       |
| XI            | XP             | IX's expand Page register                  |
| YI            | YP             | IY's expand Page register                  |
| n/a           | IP             | Index Page pair register composed of YP:XP |

For brevity purposes, the few times X or Y are mentioned explicitly in the operations lists below, they will also imply the ability to use X1/X2 instead, respectively.
