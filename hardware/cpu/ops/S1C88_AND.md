## Execute

```
#nn     = Immediate unsigned 8-bits
A       = Register A
B       = Register B
L       = Register L
H       = Register H

[BR:ll] = Memory: (EP shl 16) or (BR shl 8) or #nn
[HL]    = Memory: (EP shl 16) or HL
[IX]    = Memory: (XP shl 16) or IX
[IY]    = Memory: (YP shl 16) or IY
[hhll]  = Memory: hhll
[IX+dd] = Memory: (XP shl 16) or (IX + dd)
[IY+dd] = Memory: (YP shl 16) or (IY + dd)

; AND Ds, Sc
;
; Ds = Destination
; Sc = Source

Ds = Ds AND Sc
```

## Description

"8-bits Destination" Logical AND with "8-bits Source".

```
Truth table:

& 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

Can be used to reset (clear) one or multiple bits via what's referred to as masking. Below is a table of bytes to AND with in order to reset certain bits:

| Reset bits | Mask to use |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Bit 0      | $FE         |
| Bit 1      | $FD         |
| Bit 2      | $FB         |
| Bit 3      | $F7         |
| Bit 4      | $EF         |
| Bit 5      | $DF         |
| Bit 6      | $BF         |
| Bit 7      | $7F         |
| All bits   | $00         |

## Conditions

* Zero: Set when result is 0
* Negative: Set when bit 7 of the result is 1

Carry and Overflow remain unchanged

## Examples

```
; A = 0x85
AND A, $80
; A = 0x80
; SC = (Zero=0):(Negative=1)
```

```
; B = 0xF0
AND B, $04
; B = 0x00
; SC = (Zero=1):(Negative=0)
```

```
; A = 0xF0
AND A, $55
; A = 0x50
; SC = (Zero=0):(Negative=0)
```
