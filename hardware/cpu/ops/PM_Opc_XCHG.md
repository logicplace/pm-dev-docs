## Execute

```
A    = (8-bits) Register A
B    = (8-bits) Register B
BA   = (16-bits) Register BA: (B shl 8) or A
HL   = (16-bits) Register HL: (H shl 8) or L
IX   = (16-bits) Register IX
IY   = (16-bits) Register IY
SP   = (16-bits) Register SP (Stack Pointer)
[HL] = (8-bits) Memory: (EP shl 16) or HL
```

```
; EX Sc2, Sc
;
; Sc2 = Source 2
; Sc  = Source
; Tr = Temporary Register

```

## Description

"Source" content is exchanged (swapped) with "Source 2".

## Conditions

None

## Examples

```
; BA = 0x1337
; HL = 0xC0D3
EX BA, HL
; BA = 0xC0D3
; HL = 0x1337
```

```
; A = 0x45
; B = 0x12
EX A, B
; A = 0x12
; B = 0x45
```
