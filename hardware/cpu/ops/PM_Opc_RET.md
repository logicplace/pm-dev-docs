## Execute

```
SC    = Register SC
NB/CB = Register NB or CB
SP    = Register SP (Stack Pointer)
PC    = Register PC (Program Counter)
```

### RET

```
; RET (Return from a subroutine)

CB = Memory[SP+2]
PC = (Memory[SP+1] SLL 8) + Memory[SP]
SP = SP + 3
```

### RETE

```
; RETE (Return from an interrupt)

CB = Memory[SP+3]
PC = (Memory[SP+2] SLL 8) + Memory[SP+1]
SC = Memory[SP]
SP = SP + 4
```

### RETS

```
; RETS (Return from a subroutine and skip 2 bytes)

CB = Memory[SP+2]
PC = (Memory[SP+1] SLL 8) + Memory[SP] + 2
SP = SP + 3
```
