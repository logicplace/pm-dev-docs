# Display start line set

* To set the starting row to n, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_SHIFT(n);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0x40 | n;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #040h | n`

This shifts the rows up by n, wrapping around. So that while normally the screen is displayed as

```
Row 0
Row 1
...
Row 62
Row 63
```

`LCD_SHIFT(1);` will instead display

```
Row 1
Row 2
...
Row 63
Row 0
```
