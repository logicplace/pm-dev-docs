# V5 voltage regulator internal resistor ratio set

Don't mess with this as it could possibly damage the LCD.

* To set the Rb/Ra ratio to the smallest, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_V5(0);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0x20;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #020h`
* To set the Rb/Ra ratio to the largest, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_V5(7);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0x27;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #027h`

This command is not used by the BIOS.
