# Read/Modify/Write

* To start RMW mode, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_RMW(ON);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xE0;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0E0h`
* To stop RMW mode, use the end command via:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_RMW(OFF);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xEE;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0EEh`

This mode causes the cursor to not increment when reading the display data. Conceptually, this could be used to blit new pixels atop the existing screen.

When the end command is sent, the cursor returns to where it was when RMW began. Conceptually, this could be used to more quickly modify a section of the screen for an animation, such as a blinking cursor or decimal seconds digits on a clock.

Because reading requires a dummy read, it may be appropriate to use this mode in order to read a single byte from the LCD without moving the cursor. If you intend to read multiple sequential bytes, though, you can do without it.
