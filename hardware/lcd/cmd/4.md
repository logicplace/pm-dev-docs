# Column Address Set

* To set the current column to n (0bHHHHLLLL), use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_COL(n);`
  * C raw
  	```c
	LCD_CTRL = 0x10 | HHHH;
	LCD_CTRL = LLLL;
	```
  * ASM:
  	```s1c88
	LD LCD_CTRL, #010h | HHHH
	LD LCD_CTRL, #LLLL
	```

The columns are displayed left to right when [ADC = normal](8.md) during write.

After reading (with RMW off) or writing, the cursor will increase by 1, up to 131 which is the index of the final column. The PM will only display columns 0-95 (inclusive) when ADC is normal and only display 131-36 (inclusive) when ADC is reversed. The details of this is discussed on the [ADC page](8.md).

When not using ADC, this technically allows for 36 bytes of arbitrary storage per row.

The current column cannot be read back.
