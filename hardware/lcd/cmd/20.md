# Power save

There are two power saving modes: sleep and standby.

* To enter sleep mode properly, use:
  * C: `_int(0x5A);`
  * ASM: `INT [5Ah]`
  * Yes, this is the LCD off routine!
* To cancel sleep mode properly, use:
  * C: `_int(0x56);`
  * ASM: `INT [56h]`
  * Yes, this is the LCD on routine!
* To enter sleep mode (from normal operation), use:
  * [Disable the static indicator](19.md)
  * [Turn off the LCD](1.md)
  * [setall on](10.md)
  * The BIOS's routine turns off the LCD first and also [disables internal power circuits](16.md)
* To enter standby mode (from normal operation), use:
  * Leave the static indicator on
  * [Turn off the LCD](1.md)
  * [setall on](10.md)
* To enter sleep mode from standby mode, use:
  * Send a [reset](14.md)
* To cancel sleep mode, use:
  * [setall off](10.md)
  * [Enable the static indicator](19.md) (PM uses 2)
  * [Turn on the LCD](1.md)
  * The BIOS's routine [enables the internal power circuits](16.md) along with other initialization
* To cancel standby mode, use:
  * [setall off](10.md)
  * [Turn on the LCD](1.md)

Sleep mode should halt all driver circuits including the power circuits, so it's unclear why the BIOS manually turns off the power circuits.

Standby mode halts everything except the static drive system for the indicator, probably.

Note that the internal driver oscillator is not enabled on the PM, but would be another difference between the modes if it were.
