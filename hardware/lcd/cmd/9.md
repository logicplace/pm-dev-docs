# Display normal/reverse

* To render as 0=white & 1=black, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_INVERT(OFF);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xA6;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0A6h`
* To render as 0=black & 1=white, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_INVERT(ON);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xA7;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0A7h`

As implied above this does not affect the contents of the display RAM it simply inverts what's displayed.
