# NOP

No operation.

* To use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_NOP();`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xE3;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0E3h`

Despite the name, this also exits test mode.

The BIOS sends a NOP command when the [LCD is initialized](../../../software/bios/disasm.md#user-content-0890). This is likely in order to combat unanticipated noise causing the driver to enter testing mode, as recommended in the docs.
