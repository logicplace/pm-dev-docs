# Page address set

* To set the current page to n, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_PAGE(n);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xB0 | n;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0B0h | n`

Specifying a new page does not reset the column cursor, which must be specified [separately](4.md).

When the cursor is incremented due to a read or write operation, the page *does not* increment even if the cursor reaches the end of the page. You must increment the page manually (and reset the column to 0) if your intention is to wrap to the next page.

Pages 0-7 contain display data display top down, normally. When [rows are reversed](15.md) page 0 ends up on the bottom.

Page 8 contains information used by static indicators. Only bit 0 (D0) is saved here, per byte written, but the full row is available, totalling 132 bits of data.

The current page cannot be read back.
