# LCD bias set

Don't mess with this as it could possibly damage the LCD.

* To use 1/9 voltage bias, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_VBIAS(NORMAL);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xA2;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0A2h`
* To to use 1/7 voltage bias, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_VBIAS(DARK);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xA3;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0A3h`

Set to normal in the BIOS during LCD initialization [here](../../../software/bios/disasm.md#user-content-089C).
