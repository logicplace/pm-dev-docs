# Static indicator

Don't mess with this as it could possibly damage the LCD.

* To turn the static indicator on, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_STATIC(x);`
  * C raw:
  	```c
	LCD_CTRL = 0xAD;
	LCD_CTRL = x;
	```
  * ASM:
  	```
	LD LCD_CTRL, #0ADh
	LD LCD_CTRL, #x
	```
* To turn the static indicator off, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_STATIC(OFF);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xAC;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0ACh`

In the BIOS, this is turned on and set to 2 (blinking at approx. half second intervals) when the [LCD is initialized](../../../software/bios/disasm/#user-content-0894) and turned off when the [LCD is turned off](../../../software/bios/disasm/#user-content-08DF) as part of the [power save sequence](20.md).
