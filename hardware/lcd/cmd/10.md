# Display all points

* To render normally, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_SETALL(OFF);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xA4;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0A4h`
* To render all pixels as on, use:
  * libpmdd: `LCD_SETALL(ON);`
  * C raw: `LCD_CTRL = 0xA5;`
  * ASM: `LD LCD_CTRL, #0A5h`

This does not alter the contents of the display RAM.

You can use this to create flashing effects. Combine with [invert](9.md) to flash white instead of black (TODO: confirm).

If the display is off, sending setall on ($A5) will enable [power saving mode](20.md).

When in standby mode, sending setall off ($A4) will cancel it. When in sleep mode, you must also send [static indicator on](19.md) to cancel it.
