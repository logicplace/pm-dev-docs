# Pokémon mini

The Pokémon mini is the smallest cartridge-based handheld video game system in the world, designed by Nintendo R\&D3 around 1999 and sold in Pokémon Centers around the globe.

Only 10 games were released (all Pokémon themed). The games are on tiny cartridges which can be inserted into the top-back of the unit. All 10 games were released in Japan, 5 were released in Europe (in multiple languages), and 4 in the USA. An additional game was released later on Pokémon Channel for GameCube, but it never saw a cartridge release.

The system features a four-way directional pad plus 3 game buttons, power and reset buttons, tiny 96x64 monochrome LCD, rumble motor, shock detector, IR blaster, EEPROM with 6 slots for game saves, game cartridge slot, and monophony sound.

The system has no region lockout and the only difference between the regions' consoles is the sticker on the back and the packaging it comes in.
